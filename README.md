# Image Classification Project
 The CIFAR-10 dataset is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition that is widely used to train the ML Algorithms.
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

### Description

* We are Building a classifier for classifying 10,000 images into ten distinct classes that include the images of ten different animals such as dogs, horses, cats, and so on using the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

* For classification purposes, we have used a Supervised Learning Algorithm i.e., Random Forest

* For reducing the dimensionality, we are using principal component analysis (PCA)

### Technology Used
